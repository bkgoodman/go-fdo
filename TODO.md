## High Priority

### Documentation

- [✅] Create comprehensive CLI commands documentation (`CLI_COMMANDS.md`)
- [✅] Document voucher management commands with examples
- [✅] Document server configuration options
- [✅] Document client configuration options

- [✅] Document delegate commands and workflows
- [✅] Document attested payload commands
- [ ] Create CLI command reference cheat sheet

### Protocol Defects

- [ ] **Throttle the device ServiceInfo poll loop.** In
  `exchangeServiceInfo20` (`to2_client_v200.go`), once `deviceDone` is set
  the loop skips the chunk-read branch entirely -- including its
  `time.Sleep(10ms)` -- and so re-sends an empty `DeviceServiceInfo` as
  fast as the network allows for as long as the owner keeps the exchange
  open. Any owner that stalls, deliberately or from a slow backend, is
  hammered by its own devices. Needs a minimum inter-round delay on the
  device side. This is a defect today, independent of deferred onboarding,
  but it also blocks the `wait` action of the proposed `fdo.defer` FSIM --
  see `DESIGN-PROPOSALS.md` §1.

- [x] **FIXED 2026-10-08:** the name comparison is skipped only for the link
  to the synthesized Owner root (bound by signature against the Owner key);
  real links still match by name. Test: `TestDelegateChainUTF8OwnerName`
  (mutation-checked). Original report: **Delegate chains with a UTF8String (or multi-RDN) top issuer were
  rejected** (found 2026-10-08 via go-fdo-meta-tool Test 26).
  `processDelegateChain` (`delegate.go` ~374) synthesizes an ephemeral Owner
  root via `GenerateDelegate(..., issuer.CommonName, ...)`, then requires
  `bytes.Equal(chain[i].RawIssuer, chain[i+1].RawSubject)` (~425). Go encodes
  the rebuilt name as PrintableString `CN=x`; OpenSSL (and RFC 5280) use
  UTF8String, and real CAs have O=/C=. So OpenSSL-issued delegate chains fail
  whenever an Owner key is supplied — BMO x5chain, meta x5chain, and TO2
  delegates alike. Fix: give the synthesized root the top cert's exact
  `RawIssuer` (or skip the name comparison for the synthesized link — its
  signature check already binds it to the Owner key). go-fdo's own tests use
  go-fdo-generated certs, which is why this was never seen. fdo-uefi-rs is
  not affected (issuers are matched by signature only).
- [ ] **Owner side never checks `ProveDevice20.hashPrev2`** (Errata 1 made it
  well-defined; the device side checks `hashPrev`). `to2_server_v200.go`.

### Code Quality

- [✅] Fix goimports formatting issues in examples/cmd/client.go
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling for CLI commands
- [ ] Add input validation for CLI flags

- [ ] Improve help text consistency across commands

### Testing — Four Provisioning Security Models

See `provisioning-security.md` for the narrative. The four models are:

1. **Owner service, unsigned payloads** — channel authority, Owner runs the service
2. **Delegate service, unsigned payloads** — channel authority, PERM.7 delegate runs the service
3. **Owner-signed payloads** — artifact authority, Owner signs, any (onboard) service delivers
4. **Delegate-signed payloads** — artifact authority, PERM.7 delegate signs, any service delivers

#### Status Matrix (go-fdo library + server + device)

| Model | Library | Server | Unit tests | Integration test | Negative integration |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | **Working** (Owner-direct unsigned accepted — channel authority) | Works (omit `-bmo-sign`) | unwrap tests + `TestUnsignedProvisioningAllowed_Matrix` | **`bmo-owner-unsigned`** | `bmo-delegate-unsigned-noperm` (onboard-only peer) |
| 2 | **Implemented** (delegate PERM.7 → accept unsigned) | Works (`-onboardDelegate` with PERM.7 chain) | 6 unwrap tests | **`bmo-delegate-unsigned`** | **`bmo-delegate-unsigned-noperm`** |
| 3 | Implemented | `-bmo-sign` works | Yes (5 tests) | **`bmo-signed`** | Unit: tampered / wrong key / wrong content type |
| 4 | Implemented | `-bmo-delegate-provision` works | Yes (3 tests) | **`bmo-delegate-provision`** | None |

#### Completed testing tasks

- [x] **Model 2 implementation**: Added `DelegateCanProvision()`, context plumbing
  (`WithDelegateProvisionAuthority` / `DelegateProvisionAuthorityFromContext`),
  threaded through both FDO 1.01 and 2.0 TO2 paths. `unwrapProvisioning` now
  accepts unsigned BMO when the TO2 peer proved PERM.7 delegate authority.
  6 unit tests + 2 integration tests (positive + negative).
- [x] **Model 4 integration test** (`test_bmo_delegate_provision`): Generates an
  Owner-rooted PERM.7 delegate chain, starts server with `-bmo-delegate-provision`,
  delivers BMO image, verifies payload integrity.
- [x] **Model 1 resolved (2026-10-02)**: The spec now states channel authority
  is REQUIRED and enabled by default (chunking-strategy.md §Channel Authority),
  so unsigned provisioning from the Owner itself MUST be accepted. The device
  previously rejected it whenever the Owner key was known, because the single
  `delegateHasProvision` bool could not distinguish Owner-direct from an
  onboard-only delegate. Replaced with `fdo.PeerAuthority`
  (`PeerOwnerDirect` / `PeerDelegateProvision` / `PeerDelegateOnboardOnly` /
  `PeerUnknown`), set from how ProveOVHdr was verified in both the 1.01 and 2.0
  TO2 paths; decision logic in `unsignedProvisioningAllowed`. The old
  `bmo-signed-negative` test (which asserted the non-compliant behaviour) is
  replaced by `bmo-owner-unsigned` (positive). `WithDelegateProvisionAuthority`
  / `DelegateProvisionAuthorityFromContext` kept as deprecated wrappers.
  Audit note: go-fdo was **not** vulnerable to the fdo-uefi-rs H4 bug
  (onboard-only delegate accepted) — it erred the other way.

- [x] **Delivery/authorization restructure (2026-10-02)**: generic delivery
  keys 5–9 (legacy -6..-10 aliases), meta-payload authentication (named
  signer / Owner / PERM.7 x5chain), D2/D3 fetched-content rules, generic
  artifact verification with fail-closed scope (`"fdo.scope"`), error codes
  9–19 — all in `fsim/chunking`. Also fixed: `DelegateHasPermission` was
  leaf-only (now every cert); BMO x5chain lacked CA/permission-chain checks;
  device ignored scope; URL/meta delivery accepted unauthenticated content.
  See fdo-uefi-rs/TODO.md PRIORITY section for full detail and test list.

#### Remaining testing tasks

- [x] `fdo.payload` device-side authorization (2026-10-02): `payload-begin`
  gated via shared `authorizeGated`; owner signing (`-payload-sign`);
  delivery modes; begin hash in unified + streaming modes. Tests unit +
  `payload-signed` / `payload-delegate-noperm`. Also fixed 5 payload
  integration tests that compared the source file with itself.
- [x] Removed dead `BMO.MetaPayloadVerifier` + interface; kept `CoseSign1Verifier` (used by go-fdo-meta-tool) as a wrapper over `chunking.VerifyMetaPayload`.

- [~] **Model 4 negative variants**: Wrong root, missing PERM.7, tampered delegate
  signature. Covered by unit tests (3 tests in `bmo_provision_test.go`). Integration
  tests are impractical because the server validates the delegate chain at startup
  (`initBMOProvisioningSigner`) — it refuses to start with a bad chain. A separate
  "bypass the guard" test harness would be needed, which is more test infrastructure
  than the risk warrants. The server startup failure IS the negative test at the
  integration level (demonstrated by `start9-delegate-signed.sh --no-provision`
  on the EFI client).
- [x] **Pre-signed artifact delivery** (2026-09-23): `BMOOwner.AddPreSignedImage()`
  accepts a pre-signed COSE_Sign1 body and delivers it as-is as the image-begin
  message. Server CLI: `-bmo-presigned type:cose_file:image_file`. This supports
  offline/HSM signing workflows where `fdo-meta-tool provision sign` (or similar)
  creates the signed artifact. Integration test: `bmo-presigned`.
- [x] **Scope emission** (2026-09-23): Server CLI flags `-bmo-scope-not-before`,
  `-bmo-scope-not-after`, `-bmo-scope-generation` added. When any scope flag is set
  alongside `-bmo-sign` or `-bmo-delegate-provision`, the scope is included in the
  COSE protected header. Integration test: `bmo-signed-scope`. EFI client parses
  and evaluates scope (QEMU test: `start13-bmo-signed-scope.sh`).
- [x] **Fix: BIOS params never sent** (2026-09-23): `bmo_owner.go` `produceInfo`
  had an early `moduleDone=true` return at line 263 when all images were done,
  before reaching the BIOS params sending code. Fixed by checking for pending
  BIOS params before returning done. Also fixed BIOS send state: all params sent
  in one message, so `biosParamIndex` advances to `len(biosParams)` immediately.

## Design Proposals (see DESIGN-PROPOSALS.md)

- [ ] **Deferred Onboarding ("Delay" FSIM)** — mechanism for server to tell device "I own you but have nothing for you yet; retry later." Requires design of retry/wait/abort semantics, interaction with credential reuse, and backoff strategy.
- [ ] **Delegated Payload Attestation** — separate TO2 transport authority from payload signing authority. Allows third-party delivery services to mechanically run TO2 without being trusted to choose/modify payloads. Builds on existing attested payload and delegate certificate infrastructure. Requires new `provision` OID and payload signature verification at the device.

## Notes

- The voucher management commands (`-list-vouchers`, `-voucher-export`) were recently added and need comprehensive documentation
- The `-db` flag is now shared between client and server commands
- All CLI commands should follow consistent flag naming conventions
- Error messages should be user-friendly and actionable
